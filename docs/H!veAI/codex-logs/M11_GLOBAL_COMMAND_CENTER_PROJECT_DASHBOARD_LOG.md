# M11 Global Command Center / Project Dashboard Builder Log

Date: 2026-08-26
Product: H!veAI
Milestone: M11
Status: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / PENDING INDEPENDENT STRICT AUDIT + USER VISUAL/NATIVE ACCEPTANCE

## Starting Repository State

- Git root: `C:\Users\sekip\Desktop\AI-Commerce-HQ files\AI-Commerce-HQ`
- Branch: `H!veAI`
- Starting local SHA after mandatory fetch/fast-forward: `146bd634b02db18dc809e41b2a8ea0409ce3c973`
- Fetch-before-prompt preflight: `git fetch origin H!veAI` completed; local was behind by 5 commits and fast-forwarded with `git merge --ff-only origin/H!veAI`.
- Starting divergence after synchronization: `HEAD...origin/H!veAI = 0 0`.
- Preserved unrelated parent-root untracked files: `start-demo.bat`, `task.md`.
- No tracked project repository outside `H!veAI` was modified.

## Task 0 Tracker Synchronization

Completed before production implementation. Updated `TASKS.md`, `CODEX_ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/H!veAI/README.md` to reflect M00-M10 PASS/CLOSED, M10A remediation/re-audit/Akilta acceptance PASS/CLOSED, M11 active implementation, 11/20 strict completed progress, M12 blocked, and the required M11 pending-audit/user-acceptance state. Historical audits were not rewritten.

## Contract and Architecture Implemented

- Added native `project_dashboard` resolver for the fixed registered-root path `.hiveai/PROJECT_DASHBOARD.md`.
- Enforced bounded manifest reads: 64 KiB manifest, 4096-byte lines, 32 front-matter fields, 128 total source paths, 32 paths per role, and 512-byte source path tokens.
- Enforced UTF-8, exact `hiveai-project-dashboard/v1`, `dashboardMode: source-map`, backtick path extraction, no manifest checkbox task inventory, relative path validation, physical containment, and registered Git identity checks.
- Represented `VALID`, `PARTIAL`, `ABSENT`, `MALFORMED`, `STALE`, and `UNAVAILABLE` states plus `CANONICAL`, `NOT_CANONICALIZED`, and `FALLBACK_M08_M09` task authority.
- Canonical task summaries filter persisted M09 tasks by the resolved source path. `NOT_CANONICALIZED` produces no invented task counts. Fallback states use bounded M08/M09 evidence without claiming canonical authority. Duplicate task IDs are de-duplicated.
- Added bounded native `hiveai_command_center_snapshot` and narrow `hiveai_project_dashboard_resolve` IPC commands with explicit capability permission.
- Replaced the routed native Command Center operational surface with Registry/M09/M10 evidence: six bounded KPI cards, names-only project rail, stable selected project, explicit cockpit navigation, factual brief, attention list, work queue, recent activity search/type filtering, and truthful native status panels.
- Browser preview uses an unavailable/native-evidence state without fake portfolio metrics. The retained placeholder action is explicitly unavailable and does not execute native operations.
- Watcher task-candidate classification includes `.hiveai` paths. Relevant debounced changes invoke the existing M09 parser and emit only the minimal `hiveai-command-center-refresh` event. Parse/refresh failures do not replace persisted last-good evidence.
- Command Center refresh uses a generation guard and cleans up the native event listener.
- Session selection persistence is scoped to Command Center selections so task-source workspace tests and page-level project selection do not contaminate one another.

## Bounds and Enums

- Visible projects: 128.
- Recent activity: 50 default, 200 hard maximum.
- Attention items: 100.
- Work queue items: 100.
- Dashboard and task authority values are serialized as explicit uppercase categorical states; no provider, GPT-4o, adapter, recommendation, or fake operational status is generated.

## Changed Files

- `TASKS.md`, `CODEX_ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`, `docs/H!veAI/README.md`
- `src-tauri/src/project_dashboard.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/command_center.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/watcher.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
- `src-tauri/permissions/foundation.toml`

## Focused Tests

- M11 frontend: PASS, 3/3 tests.
- M07/M08 focused regression: PASS, 37/37 tests.
- M08 task-source focused regression: PASS, 20/20 tests.
- Full frontend suite: PASS, 9 test files / 83 tests.
- Added native resolver parser, containment, fallback, and watcher classification tests.
- `cargo test --no-run`: PASS; native test binaries compile.
- Native test execution attempted sequentially and failed before test execution with Windows `STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND` (`0xc0000139`) while launching the generated Rust test executable. This remains explicitly unverified, not converted to PASS.

## Full Gates

- `cargo fmt -- --check`: PASS.
- `cargo check`: PASS with pre-existing non-blocking warnings.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: PASS.
- `npm.cmd run build`: PASS.
- `npm.cmd audit --audit-level=high`: PASS, 0 vulnerabilities.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- First invalid multi-filter Cargo test invocation was retained as a failed evidence attempt; subsequent focused Cargo invocation reached the Windows launcher limitation above.
- An initial post-clean parallel Cargo test attempt also reached the same Windows launcher limitation. No source assertion failure was observed.

## Governed QA Publication

- `scripts/publish-dev-qa.ps1`: PASS on the second bounded attempt.
- Tauri production build used `--no-bundle`.
- Candidate smoke test passed: PE validation, H!veAI window title, no forbidden development port, frontend-ready marker, no new visible console host, candidate cleanup.
- Stable promotion passed through candidate staging and rollback copy validation.
- Stable executable: `dev-bin\H!veAI.exe`.
- Stable SHA-256 after final publication: `593E1E143FC8F74EAE3EC9D1C479BD83BF1E217DB1BCB5DC82488504A95555D9`.
- Final publication included the required-actor and bounded active-work-queue evidence in the Command Center surface.
- Desktop shortcut target: `dev-bin\H!veAI.exe`.
- Desktop shortcut icon: `dev-bin\H!veAI.ico,0`.
- Release bundle directory checked absent; no installer was created.
- First publication attempt timed out at the external command limit during the release build; stable executable remained unchanged and the helper was rerun with a longer bounded timeout. This is retained as a failed attempt, not hidden.

## Security and Safety Review

- Resolver reads only the fixed manifest below each registered project root and validates physical containment before reading referenced sources.
- Absolute, UNC, drive-qualified, parent traversal, control-character, overlong, missing, and symlink-escaped paths are rejected or downgraded to explicit non-canonical states.
- IPC exposes one bounded snapshot and one project-specific resolver; no arbitrary path-read command was added.
- No secrets, databases, caches, build outputs, or user runtime data were added to Git.
- No external project repository was edited. No inherited commerce/trading/social/publishing operation was run.
- No installer, browser launcher replacement, sidecar, adapter, GitHub integration, Prompt Engine, GPT Audit Engine, or recommendation generator was added.

## Acceptance Pending User

The following are intentionally pending and must not be represented as builder PASS:

- User visual acceptance against the canonical dashboard reference at desktop and responsive widths.
- User native acceptance of the published Command Center live data, Project Dashboard authority states, watcher-to-refresh behavior, and existing startup video/audio/background/footer/Akilta Chrome behavior.
- Independent strict M11 audit.

## Final Repository State

- Tracker/log state must remain M11 implementation complete and pending independent audit/user acceptance; M12 remains blocked.
- Implementation commit SHA: `010906876a0e0be774cbf61f4e0ce2b59ed410ca`.
- Post-implementation fetch proof: local `010906876a0e0be774cbf61f4e0ce2b59ed410ca`, `origin/H!veAI` `010906876a0e0be774cbf61f4e0ce2b59ed410ca`, divergence `0 0`.
- A final documentation-only commit will contain this closure record; its SHA and the final post-push equality proof are reported after that push.
