# M04 SQLite and Versioned Migrations Codex Log

Product: H!veAI

## Milestone start

- Timestamp: 2026-08-24 Europe/Istanbul
- Milestone: M04 - H!veAI SQLite and Versioned Migrations
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Repository root: `C:\Users\sekip\Desktop\AI-Commerce-HQ files\AI-Commerce-HQ`
- Application root: `C:\Users\sekip\Desktop\AI-Commerce-HQ files\AI-Commerce-HQ\H!veAI`
- Branch: `H!veAI`
- Synchronized starting HEAD: `6b1d3959d5598085baf346ef7d11f0fc872ad982`
- Remote: `origin https://github.com/Sekiph82/AI-Commerce-HQ.git`
- Preserved user state: `stash@{0}`, untracked `start-demo.bat`, untracked `task.md`

## Fetch-before-prompt preflight

- Read `H!veAI/AGENTS.md` before prompt access.
- Opened the official GitHub branch URL: `https://github.com/Sekiph82/AI-Commerce-HQ/tree/H!veAI`.
- Ran `git fetch origin H!veAI`; remote advanced from `5190702` to `6b1d395`.
- Ran `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/H!veAI`: `0 3`.
- No conflicting tracked changes existed, so `git merge --ff-only origin/H!veAI` safely advanced the checkout to `6b1d395`.
- Read the authoritative M03 audit and M04 prompt from the synchronized checkout.

## Repository preflight

- `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`: canonical parent Git root confirmed.
- `git branch --show-current`: `H!veAI`.
- `git rev-parse HEAD`: `6b1d3959d5598085baf346ef7d11f0fc872ad982`.
- `git remote -v`: canonical HTTPS origin confirmed.
- `git status --short`: only preserved untracked `start-demo.bat` and `task.md`.
- `git stash list`: preserved pre-M00 user package-change stash confirmed.
- Tags and worktrees inspected; `H!veAI` contains no `.git` directory.

Historical M00, M01, M02 and M03 Codex logs will remain unchanged.

## Design decisions

- Selected Rust `rusqlite` with the `bundled` feature for a deterministic local SQLite engine without Python or an external service.
- Production database path is Tauri app-data for identifier `ai.hiveai.desktop`, with stable filename `hiveai.db`; status reports only the sanitized relative filename.
- Migration history is stored in `migrations`; migrations are contiguous, ordered, transactional and fail startup without swallowing errors.
- The initial schema covers all architecture persistence entities. Migration 1 creates tables and migration 2 creates lookup indexes.
- Tests open only isolated temporary databases. M04 does not register or scan real projects and does not touch the parent legacy database.
- M03 remains intact: Rust-native runtime, no always-on Python sidecar, and no legacy commerce startup.

## Implementation log

Implementation and verification entries will be appended chronologically. Failures will remain recorded when corrected.

### 2026-08-24 - persistence implementation

- Added `src-tauri/src/db/mod.rs` for app-data database initialization and sanitized status, plus `src-tauri/src/db/migrations.rs` for ordered transactional migrations.
- Added two migrations: version 1 creates the complete H!veAI architecture schema; version 2 creates explicit lookup indexes.
- Added `rusqlite` with bundled SQLite and `tempfile` for isolated tests. Cargo lock updated without a second persistence stack.
- Added `hiveai_database_status` read-only IPC and the narrow `allow-database-status` capability permission.
- Added a minimal database readiness panel and browser-preview unavailable state; M02 dashboard structure remains unchanged.
- Added M04 migration documentation under `docs/migration/`.

### 2026-08-24 - frontend verification

- `npm run typecheck`: PASS.
- `npm test -- --reporter=dot`: PASS, 9 tests.
- `npm run build`: PASS.

### 2026-08-24 - Rust formatting failure and correction

- First `cargo fmt --manifest-path H!veAI/src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check` reported formatting differences in the new database module; ran `cargo fmt` and the follow-up check passed.
- First `cargo check` found an immutable migration statement still alive when opening a mutable transaction. Correction: scoped and explicitly collected migration rows before applying transactions.
- Follow-up `cargo check`, `cargo test`, and `cargo build` passed.

### 2026-08-24 - database verification

- Rust suite passed: 15 tests total, including 10 M04 database tests and 5 preserved M03 runtime tests.
- Fresh migration reached schema version 2; rerun returned `ALREADY_CURRENT`; history recorded two named UTC migrations.
- Foreign keys were enabled; all required tables and declared representative indexes existed.
- Intentional migration failure rolled back the failing transaction; incorrectly versioned history failed safely.
- Representative project/repository/task/prompt/audit relationships enforced foreign keys.
- Production path resolver was not used by tests; isolated temporary databases were used and no parent `hq.db` was touched.
- `TASKS.md` M04 items were updated only after verification.

### 2026-08-24 - bounded Windows smoke

- `npm run tauri:dev` launched the child Vite server and H!veAI Tauri debug executable.
- Window title: `H!veAI`; Vite response: `200` at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.
- Startup log reported `schema_version=2`; runtime status log matches: `2`; database status log matches: `1`.
- Production database was created only at `C:\Users\sekip\AppData\Roaming\ai.hiveai.desktop\hiveai.db` during this smoke; the status surface reported only `hiveai.db`.
- Legacy process count: `0`; port `8765` listeners: `0`.
- Ctrl+C stopped Tauri/Vite; follow-up found zero H!veAI processes, zero port-5173 listeners, and zero legacy processes.

### 2026-08-24 - containment and staged diff review

- `git diff --check`: PASS with line-ending warnings only.
- Staged files are confined to `H!veAI/`; no parent application source/package files were staged.
- No production database, temporary database, `node_modules`, `dist`, `target`, runtime log, secret, or `.env` artifact was staged.
- M00, M01, M02 and M03 Codex logs remain unchanged.
- The pre-M00 stash and untracked parent `start-demo.bat` and `task.md` remain preserved.

### 2026-08-24 - commit, push and GitHub verification

- Implementation commit: `dc28df3` (`feat(H!veAI): add SQLite persistence and migrations`).
- `git push origin H!veAI`: passed; remote advanced from `6b1d395` to `dc28df3`.
- Verified separate GitHub log paths on branch `H!veAI`:
  - `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M00_FRESH_START_CODEX_LOG.md`
  - `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M01_TAURI2_FOUNDATION_CODEX_LOG.md`
  - `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M02_UI_SHELL_AND_DESIGN_SYSTEM_CODEX_LOG.md`
  - `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M03_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_CODEX_LOG.md`
  - `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M04_SQLITE_AND_VERSIONED_MIGRATIONS_CODEX_LOG.md`
- Final log-only verification commit: `60c283d` (`docs(H!veAI): verify M04 publication`) pushed successfully; this M04 log is now remote-visible.
- M05 was not started; no M05 prompt was created by Codex.

PHASE STATUS: COMPLETE

Exact next milestone: `M05 — Project Registry`.
