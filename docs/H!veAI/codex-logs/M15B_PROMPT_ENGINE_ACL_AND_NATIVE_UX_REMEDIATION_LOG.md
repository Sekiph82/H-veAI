# M15B Prompt Engine ACL and Native UX Remediation Log

Date: 2026-09-05
Branch: H!veAI
Authoritative prompt: `docs/H!veAI/prompts/M15B_PROMPT_ENGINE_ACL_AND_NATIVE_UX_REMEDIATION_PROMPT.md`
Scope: M15-R56 through M15-R58 only
Status: M15B remediation complete; M15 remains OPEN pending independent re-audit and user native acceptance.

## Synchronization and boundaries

- Ran `git fetch origin H!veAI`.
- Fast-forward synchronized local `H!veAI` from `63b363b345274b931bafccd3d331910160149019` to `e9f7d0e7b03ea655cbafc899ddb5749b87d57890` before implementation.
- Starting synchronized `HEAD...origin/H!veAI`: `0 0`.
- Read the full M15B prompt, M15 strict audit, M15A strict re-audit, and M15A native acceptance audit.
- M14 remains PASS/CLOSED. M15 remains OPEN. M16 remains blocked/not activated. M21 remains planned/not started.
- Roadmap truth remains 15/20 = 75%.
- Parent-level unrelated files `start-demo.bat` and `task.md` remained untouched and untracked.
- No historical M15/M15A logs or audits were rewritten. No installer, M16, M21, or unrelated UI redesign was added.

## M15-R56 ACL remediation

The pre-fix native acceptance audit recorded the exact failure from the published app:
`Command hiveai_prompt_generate not allowed by ACL`.
The audit also confirmed that all seven Prompt Engine handlers were registered in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` but absent from the main-window capability and `foundation.toml`. This is the reproduction evidence for R56 before the fix.

Added the narrowly scoped `allow-prompt-engine` permission in `src-tauri/permissions/foundation.toml` containing exactly:

- `hiveai_prompt_context_collect`
- `hiveai_prompt_generate`
- `hiveai_prompts_list`
- `hiveai_prompt_versions`
- `hiveai_prompt_edit`
- `hiveai_prompt_approve`
- `hiveai_prompt_dispatch`

Added only `allow-prompt-engine` to the `main-window` capability in `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`. No shell, process, executable, argv, or unrelated provider command was added. `npx --no-install tauri permission ls` lists the permission and exactly these commands.

## M15-R57 vertical workflow

Prompt Engine now uses one full-width `prompt-engine-flow` with three vertically ordered panels:

1. Context and goal: active project, shared task picker, prompt kind, title, summary, refresh context, generate draft, and manifest disclosure.
2. Review and approve: full-width generated body editor, save edit, exact-version approval, and explicit approval state.
3. Provider and dispatch: provider selection, dispatch action, version history, and provenance disclosure.

The previous primary two-column `prompt-engine-layout` was removed. The editor has full available width, bounded wrapping, and responsive controls. No horizontal Prompt Engine overflow is introduced; mobile rules stack actions and provider controls. Approval and dispatch remain separate explicit human actions.

## M15-R58 provider and task controls

The provider dropdown was replaced by one keyboard-focusable, `aria-pressed` Codex/Claude segmented control. One provider state is maintained; selecting a provider never dispatches. The backend allowlist and M15A durable reservation remain unchanged. The project preferred provider is used when present, with CODEX as the safe fallback.

The task picker is one project-neutral `PromptTaskPicker` rendering path for every registered project. It bounds long option labels to a concise `<title> · <state>` display, preserves the full title in the select tooltip and accessible description, and keeps the option value as the exact task ID. A deliberately long Bulk-Edit-like title fixture verifies truncation, discoverability, keyboard-standard native select behavior, and absence of project-specific branches.

The inherited native audit identified the presentation cause for the poor Bulk Edit experience as long task content competing with the old compressed two-column panel width. The remediation removes that shared width pressure and applies the same bounded picker contract to AI-Commerce-HQ and Bulk Edit; no project-name condition exists in the implementation.

## Native acceptance boundary

Native acceptance was attempted through the available Windows UI harness, but no targetable native app windows were exposed in this environment; only the Codex in-app browser was listed. Therefore no native provider operation was started and no user-data-bearing project/task was entered. Gates 70-80 remain PENDING for user native acceptance in the published stable EXE. This is intentionally not represented as a fabricated PASS.

The required native sequence remains: open Prompt Engine, select a safe ACTIVE project/task, generate without ACL error, verify bounded context and vertical layout, approve one exact version, choose an available provider, dispatch once, verify final response and exact provenance, then retry and prove no second provider session.
