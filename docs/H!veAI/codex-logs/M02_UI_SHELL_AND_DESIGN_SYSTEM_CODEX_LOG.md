# M02 UI Shell and Design System Codex Log

## Milestone start

- Timestamp: 2026-08-24 Europe/Istanbul
- Milestone: M02 - H!veAI UI Shell and Design System
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Repository root: `C:\Users\sekip\Desktop\AI-Commerce-HQ files\AI-Commerce-HQ`
- Application root: `C:\Users\sekip\Desktop\AI-Commerce-HQ files\AI-Commerce-HQ\H!veAI`
- Branch: `H!veAI`
- Starting HEAD: `3a291a5`
- Remote: `origin https://github.com/Sekiph82/AI-Commerce-HQ.git`
- Preserved user state: `stash@{0}`, untracked `start-demo.bat`, untracked `task.md`

## Required preflight

Commands and results:

- `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` confirmed the canonical parent root.
- `git branch --show-current` returned `H!veAI`.
- `git rev-parse HEAD` returned `3a291a5` before implementation.
- `git remote -v` confirmed the canonical HTTPS origin.
- `git status --short` showed only preserved untracked user files.
- `git stash list` confirmed the preserved pre-M00 package-change stash.

Required M02 inputs were read before coding: the M01 audit, Codex log README, repository governance docs, M00/M01 historical logs, and the complete M02 prompt.

## Implementation log

This section is appended chronologically during implementation. Prior failures remain recorded when they are corrected.

### 2026-08-24 - frontend implementation

- Added the child-only UI dependency set: `framer-motion`, `lucide-react`, `react-router-dom`, Vitest, Testing Library, and jsdom.
- Built the React shell, desktop sidebar, top bar, command palette, route composition, shared components, static fixtures, command center, project index, Project Cockpit, activity feed, and safe placeholders.
- Centralized design tokens and responsive styles in `src/styles.css`, including state colors/labels, focus rings, responsive layout, motion timing, and `prefers-reduced-motion` behavior.
- Preserved M01 native commands, logging, notification plugin, capabilities, and Tauri configuration. No native capability was broadened.
- Initial `npm install` completed with 3 dependency advisories (2 high, 1 critical). No force audit fix was applied because it could introduce unrelated dependency churn; advisories are recorded for later dependency review.

### 2026-08-24 - dependency verification failure and correction

- First `npm test` failed before tests ran: `motion-dom` did not provide the `activeAnimations` export expected by the installed Framer Motion package.
- First `npm install --save-exact motion-dom@12.23.24 motion-utils@12.23.6` failed because `motion-dom@12.23.24` is not published.
- Correction: pinned `framer-motion`, `motion-dom`, and `motion-utils` to compatible published `12.23.28` releases. TypeScript initially also rejected motion props from the mismatched package types; motion wrappers now use a local typed boundary while retaining Framer Motion runtime behavior.

### 2026-08-24 - frontend verification

- `npm run typecheck`: PASS.
- `npm test -- --reporter=verbose`: PASS, 7 tests.
- Tests cover shell render, sidebar route, StatusBadge, ProjectOperationCard, Project Cockpit route, command palette open/close, safe placeholder message, and no native operation execution.
- `npm run build`: PASS. Vite production bundle generated under ignored `dist/`.
- Updated `TASKS.md` only for verified M02 checklist items and created `docs/migration/M02_UI_SHELL_AND_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.
- CSP decision: retain M01 localhost Vite HTTP/WebSocket origins for development; production-only tightening is documented as deferred because the current single config is also the verified dev config.

### 2026-08-24 - desktop regression

- `npm run tauri:dev` launched the child Vite server and Tauri debug executable.
- Observed desktop window title: `H!veAI`.
- Observed Vite HTTP response: `200` at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.
- Native status log matches: `2` in the M01 native log.
- Legacy commerce port `8765` listeners: `0`.
- Ctrl+C closed the desktop and dev server; follow-up process check found zero H!veAI and zero port-5173 listeners. A Chromium window-class unregister warning appeared during Ctrl+C, but the process exited cleanly with the expected control-break status.
- Sidebar navigation, primary routes, cockpit route, command palette, status variants, and safe placeholder behavior are covered by the 7 passing frontend tests. No visual screenshot automation was available in this bounded smoke; production rendering is covered by the successful Vite build and route/component tests.

### 2026-08-24 - pre-commit review

- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- M00 and M01 Codex logs remained unchanged.
- Parent application source/package files were not changed.
- Ignored generated `dist/`, `src-tauri/target/`, and `node_modules/` were not staged.
- Preserved untracked parent files `start-demo.bat` and `task.md`; preserved the pre-M00 stash.

### 2026-08-24 - commit

- Focused commit created: `a1f23f7 feat(H!veAI): build command center UI shell`.
- Commit contains the new M02 Codex log, migration document, frontend shell, fixtures, tests, dependency updates, and M02 task updates.
- No parent source/package files or generated artifacts were staged.
- Push to `origin/H!veAI` is the remaining publication step before final GitHub verification.

### 2026-08-24 - GitHub verification

- Initial implementation push succeeded: `3a291a5..a1f23f7 H!veAI -> H!veAI`.
- GitHub branch verification returned `a1f23f7d8e75cb2cf1e5e130607dc6dae77a7b06` for `refs/heads/H!veAI`.
- Verified separate GitHub files under `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/`:
  - `M00_FRESH_START_CODEX_LOG.md` visible.
  - `M01_TAURI2_FOUNDATION_CODEX_LOG.md` visible.
  - `M02_UI_SHELL_AND_DESIGN_SYSTEM_CODEX_LOG.md` visible.
- M00 and M01 historical files remained unchanged throughout M02.

PHASE STATUS: COMPLETE

Final verification state before the log-only follow-up: M02 acceptance criteria passed; M03 was not started and no M03 prompt was created or recommended.
