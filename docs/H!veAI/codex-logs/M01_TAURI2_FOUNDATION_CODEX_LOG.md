- Opened GitHub branch: `https://github.com/Sekiph82/AI-Commerce-HQ/tree/H!veAI`.
- Fetched latest `origin/H!veAI` and fast-forwarded from `3a1b90441ac9171d26d2979f8728001d82b73a64` to `6f1727a0993ff0ea115ac086be3a1a07e3ad38ac`.
- Read required M01 prompt: `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/prompts/M01_TAURI2_FOUNDATION_PROMPT.md`.
- Read required control docs: `AGENTS.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TASKS.md`, `CODEX_ROADMAP.md`, H!veAI protocol README, M00 audit approval, Codex log standard, and M00 Codex log.
- Mandatory preflight commands:
  - `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`: `C:/Users/sekip/Desktop/AI-Commerce-HQ files/AI-Commerce-HQ`
  - `git branch --show-current`: `H!veAI`
  - `git rev-parse HEAD`: `6f1727a0993ff0ea115ac086be3a1a07e3ad38ac`
  - `git remote -v`: `origin https://github.com/Sekiph82/AI-Commerce-HQ.git`
  - `git status --short`: untracked `start-demo.bat`, `task.md`
  - `git stash list`: `stash@{0}: On hiveai-rebuild: preserve pre-M00 user package changes before H!veAI branch switch`
- Verified local M00 log exists separately at `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M00_FRESH_START_CODEX_LOG.md`.
- Verified local M01 log did not exist before M01 and is now created separately.
- Confirmed no parent app code changes before beginning implementation.

Implementation:

- Inspected child workspace: `package.json`, `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `TASKS.md`, placeholder `src/`, `src-tauri/`, `tests/`, and no child
  `.gitignore`.
- Confirmed M00 had not implemented real product UI.
- Checked current package versions:
  - `@tauri-apps/api`: `2.11.1`
  - `@tauri-apps/cli`: `2.11.4`
  - `@tauri-apps/plugin-notification`: `2.3.3`
  - `react`: `19.2.8`
  - `vite`: `8.2.2`
  - `typescript`: `7.0.2`
- Checked current Rust crates:
  - `tauri`: `2.11.5`
  - `tauri-build`: `2.6.3`
  - `tauri-plugin-log`: `2.9.0`
  - `tauri-plugin-notification`: `2.3.3`
- Created a child React + TypeScript + Vite foundation under `H!veAI/`.
- Created a fresh Tauri 2 shell under `H!veAI/src-tauri/`.
- Added minimal native commands: `hiveai_native_status`,
  `hiveai_request_restart`.
- Added minimal capabilities and app-defined command permissions.
- Added logging and notification plugins.
- Copied existing `src-tauri/icons/icon.ico` into the child Tauri icon folder as
  a temporary Windows resource placeholder only. No parent app code was copied.

Dependency isolation:

- Ran `npm install` from `H!veAI/`.
- Result: added 28 packages, audited 29 packages, 0 vulnerabilities.
- Generated `H!veAI/package-lock.json`.

Failures and fixes:

- `npm run typecheck` failed because TypeScript could not type the CSS
  side-effect import `./styles.css`.
- Fixed by adding `H!veAI/src/vite-env.d.ts`.
- `npm run build` then failed because Vite walked up to parent
  `postcss.config.js` and could not find parent `autoprefixer`.
- Fixed by adding child `H!veAI/postcss.config.js`.
- First direct Windows debug-exe smoke opened a `H!veAI` window, but no native
  IPC log entry appeared because the debug executable was not loading the child
  dev frontend.
- Fixed smoke method by starting the child Vite dev server before launching the
  desktop executable.

Verification:

- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed.
- `npx tauri --version`: `tauri-cli 2.11.4`.
- `cargo check --manifest-path H!veAI/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: passed.
- `cargo test --manifest-path H!veAI/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: passed, 0 tests.
- `cargo build --manifest-path H!veAI/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: passed.
- Windows smoke with child Vite + desktop executable: passed.
  - `window_title=H!veAI`
  - native IPC log: `C:\Users\sekip\AppData\Local\ai.hiveai.desktop\logs\hiveai.log`
  - native status IPC match count changed from `0` to `2`
  - port `8765` listener count stayed `0 -> 0`
  - desktop process closed cleanly

Security:

- No shell, filesystem, dialog, process, HTTP, or broad network permissions
  added.
- No parent `package.json`, parent lockfile, parent `src`, parent backend, or
  parent `src-tauri` files modified.
- Preserved `stash@{0}` untouched.
- Preserved untracked `start-demo.bat` and `task.md` untouched.

Blocked/manual:

- Full restart-cycle verification remains manual/blocked. The command compiles
  and is permissioned, but automation did not click it to avoid leaving a
  restarted desktop process running.

Final pre-commit validation:

- `git status --short`: only M01-owned changes under `H!veAI/` plus preserved
  untracked `start-demo.bat` and `task.md`.
- `git branch --show-current`: `H!veAI`.
- `git rev-parse HEAD`: `6f1727a0993ff0ea115ac086be3a1a07e3ad38ac`.
- `git remote -v`: `origin https://github.com/Sekiph82/AI-Commerce-HQ.git`.
- `git diff --check`: passed with line-ending warnings only.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed.
- `npx tauri --version`: `tauri-cli 2.11.4`.
- `cargo check --manifest-path H!veAI/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: passed.
- `cargo test --manifest-path H!veAI/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: passed.
- `cargo build --manifest-path H!veAI/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: passed.

Commit/push plan:

- Create focused M01 implementation commit:
  `feat(H!veAI): establish Tauri 2 desktop foundation`.
- Push normally to `origin/H!veAI`.
- Verify M00 and M01 logs on GitHub as separate files.
- Append GitHub verification results to this M01 log in a follow-up log-only
  commit if needed.

Push integration note:

- Created local commit `8d992aebe750490c7ce2b0c7b711096915375a6b` with message
  `feat(H!veAI): establish Tauri 2 desktop foundation`.
- First `git push origin H!veAI` was rejected because `origin/H!veAI` advanced.
- Fetched latest remote updates. New remote commits removed duplicate root-level
  protocol docs and did not conflict with child `H!veAI/` M01 work.
- Rebased unpublished local M01 commit onto `origin/H!veAI`.
- New local M01 commit after rebase: `c3b325f49c6400332483a6de284ebd9feaf06c40`.
- Preserved untracked `start-demo.bat` and `task.md`.
- No force push used.

Final GitHub verification:

- Main M01 implementation commit pushed to `origin/H!veAI`:
  `9f702258fcd65af3e36b12b081238de2078389f7`.
- Remote branch verification:
  `refs/heads/H!veAI` points to
  `9f702258fcd65af3e36b12b081238de2078389f7`.
- Verified M00 Codex log is visible on GitHub as a separate historical file:
  `https://github.com/Sekiph82/AI-Commerce-HQ/blob/H%21veAI/H%21veAI/docs/H%21veAI/codex-logs/M00_FRESH_START_CODEX_LOG.md`.
- Verified M01 Codex log is visible on GitHub as a separate file:
  `https://github.com/Sekiph82/AI-Commerce-HQ/blob/H%21veAI/H%21veAI/docs/H%21veAI/codex-logs/M01_TAURI2_FOUNDATION_CODEX_LOG.md`.
- This final verification section will be pushed as a log-only M01 follow-up
  commit so the GitHub-visible M01 log records its own verification outcome.

Final phase status:

- PHASE STATUS: COMPLETE.
- M01 established the Tauri 2 foundation only.
- M02 was not started.
- Exact next milestone: `M02 -- H!veAI UI Shell and Design System`.
