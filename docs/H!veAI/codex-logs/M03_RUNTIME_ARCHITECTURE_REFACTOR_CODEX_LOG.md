# M03 Runtime Architecture Refactor Codex Log

## Milestone start

- Timestamp: 2026-08-24 Europe/Istanbul
- Milestone: M03 - H!veAI Runtime Architecture Refactor
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Repository root: `C:\Users\sekip\Desktop\AI-Commerce-HQ files\AI-Commerce-HQ`
- Application root: `C:\Users\sekip\Desktop\AI-Commerce-HQ files\AI-Commerce-HQ\H!veAI`
- Branch: `H!veAI`
- Synchronized starting HEAD: `0ac2736`
- Remote: `origin https://github.com/Sekiph82/AI-Commerce-HQ.git`
- Preserved user state: `stash@{0}`, untracked `start-demo.bat`, untracked `task.md`

## Fetch-before-prompt preflight

- Read `H!veAI/AGENTS.md` before prompt access.
- Ran `git fetch origin H!veAI` before reading the M02 audit and M03 prompt.
- Fetch advanced local remote tracking state from `594de01` to `0ac2736`.
- Ran `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/H!veAI` after fetch and fast-forwarded safely because local tracked state had no changes.
- Ran `git merge --ff-only origin/H!veAI`; synchronized checkout now matches `origin/H!veAI`.
- Read the authoritative M02 audit and M03 prompt from the synchronized checkout.

## Required repository preflight

Commands and results are recorded here before product implementation:

- `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` confirmed the canonical parent root.
- `git branch --show-current` returned `H!veAI`.
- `git rev-parse HEAD` returned `0ac2736`.
- `git remote -v` confirmed the canonical HTTPS origin.
- `git status --short` showed only preserved untracked parent files.
- `git stash list` confirmed the preserved pre-M00 package-change stash.
- Tags and worktrees were inspected; no H!veAI child `.git` directory exists.

Historical M00, M01 and M02 logs are preserved and will not be edited.

## Implementation log

This section is appended chronologically during implementation. Prior failures remain recorded when corrected.

### 2026-08-24 - baseline and evidence inventory

- Baseline `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`: passed; existing M02 suite had 7 tests.
- Baseline Rust `cargo fmt -- --check`, `cargo check`, `cargo test`, and `cargo build`: passed; M01 Rust tests reported zero tests.
- Read-only inventory inspected parent `backend/main.py`, `backend/database/db.py`, `backend/api/websocket.py`, `backend/agents/base_agent.py`, `backend/orchestrator/gmo.py`, all orchestrator names, `backend/requirements.txt`, `dev.py`, and parent `src-tauri/src/main.rs`.
- Evidence: parent FastAPI lifespan initializes SQLite, starts GMO, creates platform orchestrators, and listens on port 8765; parent Tauri can spawn bundled `backend.exe` or Python, poll/restart it, and kill it at window close.
- No parent backend, commerce API, marketplace, trading, social, or publishing operation was launched.

### 2026-08-24 - dependency/security review

- Initial scoped `npm audit --json`: 2 high and 1 critical. High findings were direct `react-router-dom@7.8.2` via `react-router`; critical finding was direct dev `vitest@3.2.4`.
- `react-router-dom` was upgraded to compatible `7.18.2`; `vitest` was upgraded to compatible `3.2.7`. No force fix or unrelated major churn.
- Final `npm audit --json`: 0 info, 0 low, 0 moderate, 0 high, 0 critical; total 0 vulnerabilities.
- Applicability recorded in `docs/migration/M03_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR.md`: client-only BrowserRouter does not use the affected server/SSR surfaces, and Vitest UI server is not used or packaged, but targeted upgrades were still applied.

### 2026-08-24 - runtime-boundary implementation

- Decision: Rust-native H!veAI core with no always-on Python sidecar.
- Added `src-tauri/src/runtime.rs` with explicit runtime state, health, component-kind enums, structured status, disabled legacy component, transition validation, bounded backoff helper, and sanitized error helper.
- Added narrow `hiveai_runtime_status` IPC while preserving `hiveai_native_status` and `hiveai_request_restart`.
- Added only `allow-runtime-status` capability permission; no shell, filesystem, HTTP, generic process, or broad network permissions.
- Registered an in-process `RuntimeSupervisor` at Tauri setup. No `Command`, `Child`, Python backend path, port 8765 probe, or child-process spawn exists in child H!veAI startup.
- Added `src/runtime.ts` and `RuntimeStatusPanel.tsx` to show truthful `RUST_NATIVE_NO_SIDECAR`, healthy native core, and disabled legacy runtime. Browser preview reports native runtime unavailable instead of fabricating health.
- Added 5 Rust tests and 1 frontend runtime-status test; M02 tests remain intact.

### 2026-08-24 - failure and correction

- First `cargo fmt --manifest-path H!veAI/src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check` reported formatting differences in runtime test assertions.
- Correction: ran `cargo fmt --manifest-path H!veAI/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`; a follow-up format check passed.
- Rust compiler emitted dead-code warnings for intentionally dormant supervisor states/helpers. Added a scoped module `allow(dead_code)` because those transition/backoff/sanitization paths are tested dormant infrastructure for future approved adapters, not unreachable product claims.
- Frontend runtime tests initially produced React `act(...)` warnings because every shell test mounted an asynchronously resolving native IPC panel. Correction: browser preview now synchronously reports Tauri-unavailable unless the Tauri runtime marker exists; the runtime test explicitly supplies the marker and awaits the status.

### 2026-08-24 - verification

- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm test -- --reporter=verbose`: passed, 8 tests.
- `npm run build`: passed.
- `cargo fmt --manifest-path H!veAI/src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check`: passed.
- `cargo check`, `cargo test`, and `cargo build`: passed; 5 meaningful Rust tests passed.
- Parent source/package files remained unchanged; no legacy runtime was launched.

### 2026-08-24 - bounded Windows smoke

- `npm run tauri:dev` launched the child Vite server and H!veAI Tauri debug executable only.
- Window title: `H!veAI`; Vite response: `200` at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.
- M01 native status log matches: `2`; M03 runtime status log matches: `1`.
- Port `8765` listeners: `0`.
- A first broad process query matched its own inspection PowerShell command because the search pattern was present in that command line. Correction: a process-name-scoped query excluding the inspection shell found `0` actual `backend.exe`/Python legacy processes.
- Desktop and Vite processes closed; follow-up found zero H!veAI processes and zero port-5173 listeners.
- Chromium window-class unregister warning appeared during Ctrl+C shutdown, but the Tauri process exited with the expected control-break status and no process remained.

### 2026-08-24 - containment and diff review

- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Child Tauri source scan found no process spawn, Python backend path, legacy backend probe, port 8765 dependency, or unrestricted shell command.
- M00, M01 and M02 Codex logs remained unchanged.
- No parent source/package file was modified.
- Ignored `node_modules`, `dist`, `src-tauri/target`, caches, binaries, runtime logs, secrets, and databases were not staged.

### 2026-08-24 - commit, push and remote verification

- Implementation commit: `b50e74d` (`refactor(H!veAI): establish runtime architecture boundary`).
- `git push origin H!veAI`: passed; remote advanced from `0ac2736` to `b50e74d`.
- Final log-only update is recorded in a separate documentation commit after this implementation commit.
- Remote verification targets:
  - `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M00_FRESH_START_CODEX_LOG.md`
  - `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M01_TAURI2_FOUNDATION_CODEX_LOG.md`
  - `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M02_UI_SHELL_AND_DESIGN_SYSTEM_CODEX_LOG.md`
  - `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M03_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_CODEX_LOG.md`
- M04 was not started; no M04 prompt was created or recommended.
