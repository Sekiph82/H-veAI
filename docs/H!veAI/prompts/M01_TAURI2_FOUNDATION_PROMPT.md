# M01 — H!veAI Tauri 2 Foundation

You are continuing H!veAI development after an independently approved M00.

Do NOT start M02.

## Canonical locations

Git root:
`C:\Users\sekip\Desktop\AI-Commerce-HQ files\AI-Commerce-HQ`

H!veAI application root:
`C:\Users\sekip\Desktop\AI-Commerce-HQ files\AI-Commerce-HQ\H!veAI`

GitHub repository:
`https://github.com/Sekiph82/AI-Commerce-HQ`

Development branch:
`H!veAI`

Canonical product name:
`H!veAI`

The second character is an exclamation mark.

## Read first

Read completely before coding:

- `H!veAI/AGENTS.md`
- `H!veAI/CONSTITUTION.md`
- `H!veAI/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `H!veAI/TASKS.md`
- `H!veAI/CODEX_ROADMAP.md`
- `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/README.md`
- `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/audits/M00_FRESH_START_AUDIT_APPROVAL.md`
- `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/README.md`
- `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M00_FRESH_START_CODEX_LOG.md`
- this prompt

## Mandatory repository preflight

Run and log:

- `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
- `git branch --show-current`
- `git rev-parse HEAD`
- `git remote -v`
- `git status --short`
- `git stash list`

Stop if:

- Git root is not the canonical parent root,
- current branch is not `H!veAI`,
- origin is not `https://github.com/Sekiph82/AI-Commerce-HQ.git` or equivalent HTTPS form.

Do not modify files if any of those checks fail.

## Preserve legacy parent state

A pre-existing stash was recorded during M00:

`stash@{0}: preserve pre-M00 user package changes before H!veAI branch switch`

Do NOT apply it.
Do NOT drop it.
Do NOT pop it.
Do NOT inspect secret-bearing content unnecessarily.

Also preserve untouched user files:

- `start-demo.bat`
- `task.md`

M01 must not repair, modernize, or refactor the legacy parent application.

The parent app's broken local `npm run build` and Tauri 1 `dist` dependency are legacy baseline issues, not M01 targets.

## Codex logs — TWO separate durable GitHub records are mandatory

M00 and M01 logs are separate historical records and MUST remain separate files.

### A. Previous M00 log — preserve and verify

Canonical file:

`H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M00_FRESH_START_CODEX_LOG.md`

Canonical GitHub destination:

`https://github.com/Sekiph82/AI-Commerce-HQ/blob/H!veAI/H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M00_FRESH_START_CODEX_LOG.md`

Rules:

- Do NOT merge M00 content into the M01 log.
- Do NOT rename the M00 log.
- Do NOT rewrite or clean up its historical entries.
- Verify the M00 log exists locally.
- Verify the M00 log exists on GitHub branch `H!veAI`.
- If the local M00 log differs from GitHub unexpectedly, STOP and report the discrepancy instead of overwriting either copy.

### B. Current M01 log — create separately

Create or continue before code changes:

`H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M01_TAURI2_FOUNDATION_CODEX_LOG.md`

Canonical GitHub destination directory:

`https://github.com/Sekiph82/AI-Commerce-HQ/tree/H!veAI/H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs`

Expected GitHub file after M01:

`H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M01_TAURI2_FOUNDATION_CODEX_LOG.md`

The M01 log must record chronologically:

- timestamps,
- commands,
- relevant outputs,
- files changed,
- decisions and reasons,
- failures,
- fixes,
- tests,
- git state,
- commit,
- push status.

Never erase failures after fixing them.
Never record secrets or token values.

Before finishing M01, verify ALL FOUR conditions:

1. M00 log exists locally at `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M00_FRESH_START_CODEX_LOG.md`.
2. M00 log exists separately on GitHub branch `H!veAI`.
3. M01 log exists locally at `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M01_TAURI2_FOUNDATION_CODEX_LOG.md`.
4. M01 log has been committed, pushed, and exists separately on GitHub branch `H!veAI`.

If either log is missing from GitHub, M01 must not be reported as fully complete.

## M01 objective

Create a clean, NEW Tauri 2 desktop foundation entirely under the H!veAI application workspace.

Do NOT upgrade the legacy parent `src-tauri/`.
Do NOT copy the legacy parent Tauri 1 app wholesale.
Do NOT implement H!veAI dashboard features yet.

M01 should establish only:

- H!veAI frontend bootstrap sufficient for Tauri 2,
- H!veAI Tauri 2 shell,
- native app identity,
- secure minimal capabilities,
- native logging,
- native notifications foundation,
- lifecycle/status commands,
- clean Windows build/run baseline.

## Step 1 — inspect child workspace

From `H!veAI/`, inspect:

- `package.json`
- `README.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `TASKS.md`
- existing `src/`
- existing `src-tauri/`
- existing `tests/`
- child `.gitignore` if any

Confirm no real product UI was accidentally implemented in M00.

## Step 2 — choose minimal frontend bootstrap

For M01 use a minimal React + TypeScript + Vite frontend inside `H!veAI/` unless the authoritative architecture docs explicitly require a different already-approved choice.

The frontend only needs to prove the Tauri app can launch.

Create a minimal placeholder screen showing:

- product name `H!veAI`
- subtitle `AI Development Command Center`
- foundation status

This is not the M02 design system.
Do not build dashboard navigation, project cards, agent UI, audit UI, or command center features yet.

## Step 3 — create Tauri 2 shell

Create a fresh Tauri 2 project under:

`H!veAI/src-tauri/`

Use current Tauri 2 conventions.

Requirements:

- app product name: `H!veAI`
- app identifier: use a valid identifier without `!`, e.g. `ai.hiveai.desktop`
- Windows desktop target
- development URL points to child Vite dev server
- production frontend points to child Vite build output
- minimal capabilities only
- no broad shell access
- no inherited commerce permissions
- no inherited parent HTTP-all or shell-open permission sets unless explicitly needed

## Step 4 — native foundation

Implement minimal native commands such as:

- `hiveai_native_status`
- `hiveai_request_restart`

The status command should return structured data sufficient to prove native IPC works.

The restart command should be implemented safely using supported Tauri 2 APIs.

Do not expose a generic arbitrary shell command.

## Step 5 — logging and notification plugins

Add current supported Tauri 2 logging and notification plugins.

Configure them minimally and securely.

The app must not request unnecessary capabilities at startup.

Document where logs are expected to be written on Windows.

## Step 6 — frontend/native IPC smoke surface

Add a minimal foundation screen that:

- renders `H!veAI`,
- invokes `hiveai_native_status`,
- displays a safe status result,
- provides a restart control only if safe for the dev foundation,
- clearly labels the screen as `M01 Foundation`.

Do not style beyond basic readable layout.
M02 owns the real UI system.

## Step 7 — dependency isolation

All H!veAI dependencies must belong to:

`H!veAI/package.json`

Do not depend on parent `node_modules`.
Do not modify parent `package.json` or parent `package-lock.json`.

Generate child lockfile normally if needed.

## Step 8 — security baseline

Document:

- Tauri capabilities enabled,
- commands exposed,
- plugins enabled,
- filesystem/shell/network permissions,
- whether notifications require runtime permission,
- log output location,
- any remaining security questions.

Create:

`H!veAI/docs/migration/M01_TAURI2_FOUNDATION.md`

## Step 9 — tests and verification

Run from the H!veAI workspace as appropriate:

Frontend:

- install dependencies using the child package manifest,
- typecheck,
- production build.

Rust/Tauri:

- `cargo check --manifest-path H!veAI/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo test --manifest-path H!veAI/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo build --manifest-path H!veAI/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

Tauri CLI:

- record `npx tauri --version` from child workspace or equivalent child-local invocation.

Windows smoke test:

- launch the H!veAI desktop app in a bounded dev/build smoke test,
- confirm the window opens,
- confirm the visible product name is `H!veAI`,
- confirm native status IPC succeeds,
- confirm the app closes cleanly,
- confirm no legacy commerce runtime starts.

If restart cannot be safely verified automatically, leave that item explicitly blocked/manual rather than falsely marking complete.

## Step 10 — TASKS.md

Update only M01-related items in:

`H!veAI/TASKS.md`

Use `[x]` only for completed and verified items.
Use `[!]` for blocked verification.
Do not mark M02 or later milestones complete.

## Step 11 — repository containment

Before commit verify:

- all new application code is under `H!veAI/`,
- no parent application source was changed,
- root `.gitignore` is changed only if strictly necessary,
- no `.env`, DB, target, dist, node_modules, logs containing secrets, caches or generated binaries are staged.

## Step 12 — final validation

Run and record:

- `git status --short`
- `git branch --show-current`
- `git rev-parse HEAD`
- `git remote -v`
- `git diff --check`
- `git diff --cached --stat` before commit if staged
- child frontend verification
- child Rust/Tauri verification

## Commit and push

If M01 is genuinely complete, create one focused commit:

`feat(H!veAI): establish Tauri 2 desktop foundation`

The milestone commit MUST include the separate M01 log:

`H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M01_TAURI2_FOUNDATION_CODEX_LOG.md`

The existing M00 log must remain independently tracked at:

`H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M00_FRESH_START_CODEX_LOG.md`

Push normally to:

`origin/H!veAI`

Do not force push.

After push, explicitly verify that BOTH files are visible separately on GitHub:

- `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M00_FRESH_START_CODEX_LOG.md`
- `H!veAI/docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/M01_TAURI2_FOUNDATION_CODEX_LOG.md`

Record both verification results in the final section of the M01 log itself. If a final M01 log update is needed after the first push, create a small follow-up documentation commit and push normally.

## M01 acceptance criteria

1. H!veAI has an independent child frontend dependency set.
2. H!veAI has a fresh Tauri 2 shell under `H!veAI/src-tauri/`.
