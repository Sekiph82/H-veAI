# H!veAI Architecture

## Decision
H!veAI is a standalone Tauri 2 desktop application rooted at
`Sekiph82/H-veAI`. The historical AI-Commerce-HQ repository is source and
migration history only.

## Reusable AI-Commerce-HQ patterns
- Tauri desktop packaging/lifecycle
- Rust-managed child backend lifecycle
- backend health polling and restart
- FastAPI/API boundary during migration
- WebSocket heartbeat/broadcast/replay pattern
- BaseAgent abstraction pattern
- async SQLite pattern
- EventRecord concept
- React/TypeScript/Vite/Tailwind/Zustand tooling

## Replace/remove
- Three.js office/game world and robots
- revenue/XP/achievements
- Etsy/Fiverr/Trading/YouTube/TikTok orchestrators
- commerce products and publication approval flows
- platform rooms/desks
- Tauri 1.x APIs
- ad-hoc SQLite migrations

## Target architecture

Frontend:
Global Command Center, Project Cockpit, Agents, Audit Center, AI Brief/Chat.

Rust native core:
Project Registry, Git Engine, filesystem watcher, PTY/process manager,
worktree manager, permission engine, notifications, lifecycle.

Domain services:
Task Source Discovery, Task Parser/Normalizer, Workflow State Machine,
Prompt Engine, Audit Engine, Next Best Task Engine, Engineering Brief.

Adapters:
Codex, Claude Code, OpenAI/Codex Audit, GitHub.

### GitHub-first tracking boundary

For the eight migrated repositories, github_tracking is the remote-primary
project read model. A dedicated background scheduler observes the tracked
GitHub branch through its commit Atom feed and fetches root `TASKS.md` through
GitHub raw content, then emits update events without using local Git fetch or a
local filesystem watcher.
Command Center KPIs, attention, queue, activity, and Project Cockpit primary
fields are derived only from that remote snapshot. Each repository has one
root `TASKS.md`; hidden `.hiveai` control-plane files are historical only.

The local registry, Git Engine, control plane, task intelligence, workflow
history, audits, agent sessions, and source inventory remain available as
secondary execution telemetry. They must not override remote milestone, task,
workflow, actor, next action, blockers, progress, health, or refresh status.

SQLite:
projects, repositories, project_sources, git_snapshots, tasks,
task_dependencies, task_sources, task_events, prompts, prompt_versions,
agent_sessions, agent_events, agent_tool_calls, permission_requests,
audits, audit_findings, test_runs, alerts, decisions, github_sync_state,
settings, migrations.

M08 Task Source Discovery is the bounded pre-parser boundary: it resolves only
registered project roots, discovers standard and explicitly configured custom
source documents, records physical-path/hash/status metadata in
`project_sources`, and exposes no source bodies or parsed task entities. It
does not write `tasks`, `task_sources`, project files, `.hiveai` configuration,
or start background discovery workers.

## Project Registry
Stores project identity, local path, git remote, GitHub owner/repo, default
branch, priority, preferred builder/auditor and task-source policy.
Registration is read-only.

## Git Engine
Reads branch, HEAD, staged/unstaged/untracked files, ahead/behind, commits,
diff, conflicts and worktrees. Writes pass through Permission Engine.

## Task Intelligence
M08-owned, versioned, AVAILABLE source inventory is the sole parse boundary.
M09 reconstructs and physically validates each source path under the Registry
root, checks the bounded UTF-8 body hash, and emits structured warnings rather
than reading arbitrary repository files. The deterministic parser persists
M09-owned `m09src:`/`m09task:` rows, `SOURCE_EXPLICIT` dependency edges, and a
project snapshot in existing SQLite tables without writing task events or
managed project files. `list` reads the persisted snapshot only. Generic,
FormuLab, ScrubBots, and FMCG ERP adapters are selected by exact Registry
identity and only add evidenced structural conventions; generic is the safe
fallback. M09 storage maps DONE to TASK_COMPLETE, BLOCKED to BLOCKED, and all
other parsed statuses to BACKLOG while retaining richer parser truth in
metadata for the future M10 workflow state machine.

## Workflow
Happy path:
BACKLOG → PLANNING_REQUIRED → PROMPT_REQUIRED → PROMPT_READY →
READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION → BUILDER_RUNNING → IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE →
AUDIT_REQUIRED → AUDIT_RUNNING → AUDIT_PASSED → VERIFY_REQUIRED →
VERIFY_RUNNING → TASK_COMPLETE.

Failure loop:
AUDIT_FAILED → FIX_REQUIRED → READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION → BUILDER_RUNNING →
IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE → RE_AUDIT_REQUIRED → AUDIT_RUNNING.

## Agent adapter contract
Each provider supports availability check, start, resume, stop, status and
streamed events. A session always belongs to one project and one task/freeform
operation, normally inside a project cwd or isolated worktree.

## Audit Engine
Audit reads task requirements, acceptance criteria, actual diff, changed
files, tests, architecture rules and builder logs as secondary evidence.
Returns PASS/FAIL/CONDITIONAL with severity findings, requirements coverage,
test confidence, regression risk and remediation prompt.

## Global Command Center
Must show portfolio KPIs, project operation cards, current task, last action,
next action, required actor, Needs Your Attention, Active Work Queue,
AI Engineering Brief and live activity.

## Project Cockpit
Tabs: Overview, Tasks, Workflow, Agents, Audit, Git, Tests, Activity, Files,
Settings. Current-task card must always explain where we are, why, evidence,
next step and primary action.

## Security
Use Tauri 2 capabilities and command allowlisting. Frontend must not get an
unrestricted shell. Secrets must be redacted from logs and stored securely.
Merge always requires human approval.

## Migration strategy
Keep Git operations at the parent repository root and put new H!veAI application
work under the child `H!veAI` directory. Treat the old parent application as
source material only. Audit and reuse infrastructure deliberately, replace the
commerce product domain and game UI, migrate Tauri first, then database and
orchestration.
