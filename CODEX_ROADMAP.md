# H!veAI Detailed Codex Roadmap

This roadmap mirrors the canonical task ledger in `TASKS.md` at milestone/package level.

Important: package numbering such as `M10.01`, `M10.02`, etc. is for traceability and auditability. It does **not** require separate Codex prompts. The default execution model remains one whole-milestone prompt, followed by independent audit and, only if necessary, bounded remediation.

User-facing roadmap denominator remains **20**. `M00` is the historical rebuild/rebaseline foundation; `M01` through `M20` are the product roadmap milestones.

## Current status

- M00-M12: PASS/CLOSED.
- M09 Task Intelligence Parser: PASS/CLOSED after the independent M09D final strict audit.
- Pre-M10 Native UX Hotfix X01/X02: PASS/CLOSED after independent source audit plus user native acceptance.
- M10 original strict audit: historical FAIL with 5 MAJOR findings.
- M10A remediation, independent re-audit, and Akilta native click acceptance: PASS/CLOSED.
- M11 original and remediation failures remain historical evidence; accepted strict audits close M11A REV7 and the final Projects visual cleanup.
- M11 = PASS/CLOSED.
- M12 = PASS/CLOSED, including M12A R26 and M12B route remediation, on accepted strict evidence and user native/visual acceptance. M13/M13A/M13B/M13C/M13D/M13E are PASS/CLOSED on accepted strict re-audits and user native/visual evidence. M14 and M14A-M14E are PASS/CLOSED on accepted strict and native evidence. M15 is PASS/CLOSED on accepted strict and user native/visual evidence. M16 remains OPEN during M16S closure remediation; M17-M20 remain planned/blocked.
- M21 standalone migration and M21-R01 through M21-R03 are PASS/CLOSED on accepted evidence; the historical local AI-Commerce parent is retired from active use, while the GitHub repository is retained for preservation and has not been deleted.
- M16S V02 is implementation-complete pending independent strict audit and owner native acceptance. Required Actor is HUMAN; M17 remains NOT ACTIVATED/BLOCKED.
- Strict completed progress is 16/20 = 80%; M16 remains OPEN during M16S, and the pre-M10 hotfix is not a numbered roadmap milestone.

M16A remediation closes M16-R59 through M16-R61 only: explicit prior-finding dispositions, exact Audit -> Prompt Engine -> Agent session provenance, and repository freshness enforcement before persistence. M17 is not activated and M21 was not started.

M16B remediation closes M16-R62 only: fresh UNAVAILABLE and MALFORMED re-audits persist truthfully without prior dispositions or false closure, while AVAILABLE disposition validation and STALE precedence remain unchanged. M17 is not activated and M21 was not started.

M16C REV2 comprehensive remediation closes M16-R63 through M16-R73: durable identity, semantic validation, explicit re-audit lifecycle, typed Git scope, complete freshness, claim-directed source/test verification, exact task authority, and canonical builder-log containment/selection. The 198-gate ledger, full regression, governed publication, and immutable remediation evidence are complete. M16 remains OPEN pending independent whole-M16 strict re-audit and user native/visual acceptance; M17 is not activated and M21 was not started.

### M16H unified project truth, remote observation, and event idempotency closure

M16H closes UCP-R19 through UCP-R21: one shared typed ProjectTruthResolver removes first-open and whole-file progress heuristics; remote observation fetches first regardless of auto-fast-forward and only clean strict-behind state may merge; and event append/retry is crash-consistent through bounded tail reconciliation with an explicit 4096-ID horizon. Full regression, governed publication, adversarial sweep, and immutable builder evidence are complete. M16 remains OPEN pending independent whole-M16 strict re-audit and user native/visual acceptance. M17 is not activated and M21 was not started.

### M16I durable project truth materialization, health precedence, and remote observation closure

M16I closes UCP-R22 through UCP-R26: one DB-aware ProjectTruthMaterializer persists resolver truth into governed STATE/HANDOFF/EVENTS, health precedence fails closed above Git cleanliness, ambiguous workflows and stale progress scopes never become current truth, and remote observation failures remain durable with last-good counts. Full whole-M16 regression, governed publication, adversarial sweep, and immutable builder evidence are complete. M16 remains OPEN pending independent whole-M16 strict re-audit and user native/visual acceptance. M17 is not activated and M21 was not started.

---

### M16J portable project identity, canonical events, and durable truth sync

M16J closes UCP-R27 through UCP-R31: portable project identity is separated from local Registry UUIDs, new events use the canonical hiveai-event/v1 core, truth synchronization is durable and retryable, HANDOFF updates are lossless managed-block replacements under repository governance, and progress scope is globally enforced. M16 remains OPEN pending independent whole-M16 strict re-audit and owner native/visual acceptance. M17 is not activated and M21 was not started.

---

### M16L truth-generation bootstrap, read purity, and portfolio fixture freshness

M16L closes UCP-R36 through UCP-R38: migration v22 repairs generation-zero bootstrap, current Project/Command Center/Cockpit reads are observational with bounded recovery only for dirty or degraded truth, and all eight portfolio fixtures are refreshed from verified live target branch refs. Full regression, governed publication, adversarial sweep, and immutable builder evidence are complete. M16 remains OPEN pending independent whole-M16 strict re-audit and owner native/visual acceptance. M17 is not activated and M21 was not started.

---

### M16M physical adoption convergence, true read purity, and portfolio provenance

M16M closes UCP-R39 through UCP-R42: physical control-plane adoption is authoritative over stale DB metadata, verified adoption converges and bootstraps durable truth, real adopted-project Command Center/Cockpit reads remain observational, and portfolio evidence separates target branch HEAD from contract blob provenance. Full regression, governed publication, adversarial sweep, and immutable builder evidence are complete. M16 remains OPEN pending independent whole-M16 strict re-audit and owner native/visual acceptance. M17 is not activated and M21 was not started.

### M16O GitHub-first tracking reset

M16O migrates all eight tracked GitHub repositories to the identical v3 contract and makes remote branch snapshots authoritative for Command Center and Project Cockpit current-state fields. M16 remains OPEN at 16/20 = 80% pending independent whole-M16 re-audit and native acceptance. M16N is superseded; M17 remains inactive, while M21 and M21-R01 through M21-R03 are accepted as recorded above.

---

## M16S - Post-M21 local workspace and GPT audit provider closure V02

- [x] M16S-F01: secure production OpenAI audit-provider boundary plus explicit bounded live model-readiness probe, strict structured output, truthful status handling, and unavailable fallback.
- [x] M16S-F02: successful audit provenance is sourced from the executing runtime provider/model/version, never generated identity fields.
- [x] M16S-F03: active project workspace attach/change/repair actions are visibly discoverable, reuse identity-preserving path repair, and preserve the current M21/M16/M17 tracker truth.
- [x] Provider/workspace focused tests, full regression, governed publication, and immutable implementation evidence complete.

M16S V02 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / PENDING INDEPENDENT STRICT AUDIT + OWNER NATIVE ACCEPTANCE. M16 REMAINS OPEN. M17 NOT ACTIVATED/BLOCKED.

## Dependency path

`M00 -> M01 -> M02 -> M03 -> M04 -> M05 -> M06 -> M07 -> M08 -> M09 -> pre-M10 UX hotfix (PASS/CLOSED) -> M10 -> M11/M12 -> M13 -> M14 -> M15 -> M16 -> M17 -> M18 -> M19 -> M20`

## Builder execution rule

Before each milestone, Codex must read `AGENTS.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TASKS.md`, and the authoritative milestone prompt; inspect/synchronize Git safely; run baseline tests; implement only the current milestone; add direct tests; run full regression/publication gates; update prospective tracking/logs truthfully; review the diff; commit/push without rewriting history; then stop for independent audit.

## Exit rule

A builder may not mark a milestone PASS/CLOSED because code was generated or tests were claimed green. Final closure requires independent audit acceptance and any required manual/native acceptance.
