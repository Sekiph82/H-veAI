# H-veAI — Canonical GitHub Task State

This root TASKS.md is the only authoritative project-status tracker consumed by H!veAI. GitHub repository metadata and the latest commit are the remaining project-truth inputs. Hidden .hiveai control-plane files are historical only and are not read for current project state.

## Project Status

- Current Milestone: M21
- Current Sprint: M21-MIGRATION
- Current Task: M21-01 — Standalone root migration and GitHub TASKS-only architecture
- Current Task Status: PASS/CLOSED
- Next Task/Action: Owner native/visual acceptance and independent retirement decision; preserve the legacy parent until explicitly retired.
- Required Actor: CODEX
- Tracking Repository: Sekiph82/H-veAI
- Tracking Branch: main

## Tasks
- [x] M21-01 — Standalone root migration and GitHub TASKS-only architecture

# H!veAI MASTER TASKS

Legend: `[x]` validated complete, `[~]` active/in progress, `[ ]` planned/pending, `[!]` blocked.

Package numbering such as `M08.01`, `M08.02`, etc. is a task/audit decomposition only. It does **not** mean a milestone must be split into separate Codex prompts. A milestone may still be implemented from one whole-milestone prompt.

## Canonical tracking rules

- This file is the canonical detailed milestone/task ledger.
- `CODEX_ROADMAP.md` mirrors milestone scope/dependencies at roadmap level.
- `docs/H!veAI/prompts/` contains authoritative builder prompts.
- `docs/H!veAI/codex-logs/` contains immutable builder execution claims/evidence logs.
- `docs/H!veAI/audits/` contains independent strict audits and final acceptance decisions.
- Builder logs are claims, not acceptance evidence.
- Historical failed prompts/logs/audits remain immutable and do not become active tasks again unless an independent later audit explicitly reopens a production defect.
- User-facing roadmap denominator remains **20** even though the historical baseline is labeled `M00` and release is `M20`.

## Current truth

- M00 through M12 are PASS/CLOSED.
- M08 presentation bootstrap, Task Source Discovery, remediation chain, and native `/tasks` manual acceptance are PASS/CLOSED.
- M09 original strict audit = historical FAIL.
- M09A strict re-audit = historical FAIL after closing the original seven findings but exposing two residual production defects.
- M09B strict re-audit = historical FAIL due residual R02C/E01C/E03C/E05 findings.
- M09C independent strict re-audit = historical CONDITIONAL, remediated by M09D.
- M09D independent final strict audit = PASS.
- M09 Task Intelligence Parser final closure = PASS/CLOSED.
- Pre-M10 Native UX Hotfix X01/X02 = PASS/CLOSED after independent source audit plus user native acceptance.
  - X01: terminal/console popup suppression accepted fixed after approximately 45 minutes of native runtime with no unwanted terminal windows.
  - X02: startup intro audio/replay behavior accepted fixed; audio works and same-process route navigation does not replay the intro.
- Strict completed milestone count remains **16 / 20 = 80%**; M16M closes UCP-R39 through UCP-R42 and is implementation-complete pending independent whole-M16 strict re-audit and user native/visual acceptance while M16 remains OPEN; the pre-M10 hotfix is not a numbered roadmap milestone.
- M10 original strict audit = historical FAIL with 5 MAJOR findings.
- M10A remediation, independent re-audit, and Akilta native click acceptance are complete; Akilta footer link = PASS/ACCEPTED.
- Original M11 implementation is a historical strict-audit FAIL with 8 MAJOR findings.
- M11A REV4, REV5, REV6, and REV7 remediation history remains immutable; all findings are closed by the accepted strict audits. M11A REV7 = PASS/CLOSED and the final Projects visual cleanup = PASS/CLOSED.
- M11 = PASS/CLOSED. M12, M12A R26, and M12B native Open Cockpit remediation = PASS/CLOSED on accepted strict evidence and user native/visual acceptance. M13/M13A/M13B/M13C/M13D/M13E = PASS/CLOSED on accepted strict re-audits and user native/visual evidence. M14 and M14A-M14E = PASS/CLOSED on accepted strict and native evidence. M15 = PASS/CLOSED on accepted strict and user native evidence. M16H closes UCP-R19 through UCP-R21; M16I closes UCP-R22 through UCP-R26; M16M closes UCP-R39 through UCP-R42 and is implementation-complete pending independent whole-M16 strict re-audit and user native/visual acceptance; M16 remains OPEN; M17-M20 remain planned/blocked and M21 remains planned/not started.
- M21 remains planned and was not started.

- [x] UCP-R29: truth synchronization is revision-aware, durable, retryable, and surfaced as CURRENT/PENDING/DEGRADED across lifecycle transitions.
- [x] UCP-R30: HANDOFF updates replace one managed block only, preserve unmanaged bytes and notes, and fail closed under PROJECT/RULES governance.
- [x] UCP-R31: progressPercent is never emitted without an exact resolved progressScope.

- [x] UCP-R37: current Project, Command Center, and Cockpit reads are observational; only dirty, pending, degraded, or mismatched truth permits bounded recovery materialization.
- [x] UCP-R38: all eight portfolio fixtures are refreshed from their actual current target branch refs with verified owner/name/schema/task-source contracts, state/handoff/events shapes, governance, rules evidence, and exact source SHAs.

# Milestone policy

- M00-M09 are PASS/CLOSED.
- Pre-M10 Native UX Hotfix X01/X02 is PASS/CLOSED after independent audit and user native acceptance.
- M10 original strict audit is historical FAIL; M10A remediation is IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / PENDING INDEPENDENT RE-AUDIT.
- M13C R32 remediation is complete; M13 remains open pending independent strict re-audit and user native/visual acceptance. M14A closes M14-R35/R36/R37; M14B closes M14-R38/R39/R40; M14 is PASS/CLOSED on accepted strict-audit and native evidence. M15 is PASS/CLOSED on accepted strict and user native/visual evidence; M16C REV2 remediation closes M16-R63 through M16-R73 and remains pending independent whole-M16 strict re-audit and user native/visual acceptance while M16 stays OPEN; M17-M20 remain planned/blocked and M21 remains not started.
- M11/M12 must implement the Project Dashboard manifest authority resolver before treating `.hiveai/PROJECT_DASHBOARD.md` as live runtime truth.
- Each future milestone should be executed as one bounded milestone unless an actual independent audit requires a remediation prompt.
- Subpackage numbering is for traceability, source/evidence mapping, and progress visibility, not an instruction to generate many tiny prompts.
- Every milestone closes only after production implementation, direct evidence, full regression, governed publication where applicable, and independent audit acceptance.
- M16O GitHub-first eight-repository tracking reset is implementation-complete: all eight target branches use the unified v3 contract, real branch state is pushed, and Command Center/Project Cockpit read remote GitHub snapshots with stale-cache fallback only. M16 remains OPEN at 16/20 = 80%; M16N is superseded and was not executed. M17 remains not activated and M21 remains not started.
